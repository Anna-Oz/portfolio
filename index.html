                    <h1>Mimblewimble Protocol Explanation: What is it and how does it work?</h1>
                    <p>
                        Today, we make a review of the Mimblewimble protocol that brings an innovative vision to
                        handling
                        transactions on the blockchain network. Mimblewimble possesses a few distinctive features that
                        can
                        solve some issues currently existing in almost all blockchain infrastructures. In the following
                        post, we describe how the protocol functions and shed light on its cryptocurrency
                        implementations.
                    </p>
                    <h2>What is Mimblewimble</h2>
                    <p>Mimblewimble is a blockchain protocol that was offered by Tom Elvis Jedusor in 2016. Mimblewimble
                        gains popularity among Bitcoin and privacy cryptocurrencies advocates due to some significant
                        improvements it brings to transactions processing on the blockchain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Mimblewimble protocol is based on two main principles: privacy and scalability. Other
                        distinctive advantages provided by the blockchain protocol include its fungibility and
                        anonymity.
                        Below, we explore the key components of Mimblewimble in more detail.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Privacy</h3>
                    <p>The inherent privacy of the Mimblewimble protocol is gained through the way of conducting
                        transactions in the network. Transactions in Mimblewimble are based on the concept of
                        Confidential
                        Transactions (CT) by Greg Maxwell, which states for obscuring the addresses of a sender and
                        receiver
                        and transferred amounts by using encryption. The validation of transactions on Mimblewimble
                        leverages two basic characteristics of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC): zero-sum verification
                        and
                        private-public key encryption.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Zero-sum verification means that the total sum of inputs deducted from the sum of outputs is
                        always
                        equal to zero. It ensures that no new funds are created or double-spent while the actual amounts
                        in
                        the transaction are shielded. Since only two parties involved in the transaction have
                        information
                        about the transacted amount of coins, ability to compare the number of inputs and outputs at the
                        start and end of a transaction is crucial for validation by outside observers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The increased confidentiality of processing blockchain transactions is guaranteed by using
                        blinding
                        factors for the inputs and outputs encryption. The blinding factor is actually the private key
                        of a
                        user that is presented by a string of numbers. In the Mimblewimble protocol, a recipient chooses
                        random values of blinding factors provided by the sender. The blinding factor is also used to
                        prove
                        the ownership of the transacted value without revealing any essential data like amounts and
                        addresses.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The concept of public verification of blockchain transaction with obfuscated details serves as a
                        basis for zero-knowledge proofs and Ring Confidential Transactions (Ring CTs) implemented by
                        some
                        other platforms, including ZCash, Monero, and Zerocoin. These concepts allow achieving true
                        digital
                        anonymity when transferring amounts on the blockchain network.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Mimblewimble protocol leverages an additional cryptographic level called CoinJoin which
                        guarantees the user anonymity in blockchain transactions. The CoinJoin mechanism allows
                        combining
                        transaction amounts from multiple senders into a single batch. This way, separate payments are
                        not
                        listed in the blockchain blocks, which makes it impossible for third parties to identify the
                        origin
                        and destination of sent values.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Obfuscation of wallet addresses and input and output amounts along with processing transactions
                        anonymously proves the fungibility of the Mimblewimble coin.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Scalability</h3>
                    <p>
                        The scaling potential of Mimblewimble is based on the cut-through method that allows aggregating
                        intermediary inputs and outputs in transaction chains. This way, the blocks have a considerably
                        smaller size, meaning that they can handle more transactions. At the same time, spent input
                        amounts
                        are removed from the transactions history providing better scalability of the network while
                        ensuring
                        the high level of anonymity and security.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Due to the cut-through approach, a Mimblewimble block is only represented by its transaction
                        kernel
                        (which ensures the ownership of the transferred amounts) and kernel offset (which acts as a
                        blinding
                        factor). The transaction kernel itself consists of the transaction signature, public key, and
                        mining
                        fee.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since privacy-focused cryptocurrencies require more space in the block to perform transactions
                        with
                        additional encryption, elimination of unnecessary data is an important concern. The methodology
                        applied by the Mimblewimble protocol to old transactions makes it more scalable and increases
                        the
                        efficiency of syncing new nodes within the network.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Implementation of Mimblewimble</h2>
                    <p>
                        Currently, there are two implementations available with the Mimblewimble protocol: Grin and
                        Beam.
                        Letâ€™s have a closer look at each of them.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Grin Cryptocurrency</h3>
                    <p>
                        Mimblewimble Grin is an experimental project that follows the core principles of the
                        Mimblewimble
                        protocol like privacy, scalability, and fungibility. The Grin mainnet was released on the 15th
                        January 2019 without ICO and pre-mine with the view of providing secure blockchain transactions
                        to
                        every person without any limitations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since Grin inherits the main characteristics from Mimblewimble, it doesnâ€™t disclose information
                        on
                        addresses and transaction amounts ensuring a high level of privacy when transferring digital
                        currency on the blockchain. One of the Mimblewimble components allowing to implement increased
                        privacy mechanisms in Grin is the Dandelion Protocol. The Protocol offers a solution for
                        potential
                        attacks to usersâ€™ anonymity on the Mimblewimble chain that uses hops between nodes before a
                        transaction is distributed to the neighboring nodes.
                    </p>
                    <p>As already mentioned above, Grin also retains the scalability feature provided by merging
                        transactions on the Mimblewimble chain and eliminating processed data from the blocks. ECC
                        cryptography utilized by the Grin cryptocurrency allows to safely remove unnecessary transaction
                        details and reduce blocks size for faster verification.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As for the Mimblewimble mining with Grin, it utilizes the Proof-of-Work consensus model that
                        uses an
                        ASIC-resistant algorithm such as Cuckoo Cycle. The mining process on Grin can run on one of the
                        two
                        types of the algorithm - Cuckaroo and Cuckatoo - aimed whether at GPU or ASIC miners.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Note that there are some improvements planned to be implemented in the Grin infrastructure,
                        including smart contracts, payment channels, atomic swaps, and onion routing.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Beam Cryptocurrency</h3>
                    <p>
                        Beam is the first implementation of the Mimblewimble protocol which mainnet was launched on the
                        3d
                        January 2019 without ICO and pre-mine. In contrast to Grin, the Beam cryptocurrency release
                        included
                        foundersâ€™ treasury. Beam also uses the proof-of-work mining scheme based on the Equihash Pow
                        algorithm which is ASIC-resistant. The ASIC resistance provides more decentralization for mining
                        on
                        the Beam network preserving the high level of security with ECC. However, comparing to Grin,
                        Beam
                        has more hierarchy in its model as well as a better-organized structure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As for the new technologies planned to be implemented for the Beam protocol in 2019, unlike
                        Grin,
                        they include a well thought-out roadmap. The development plans include switching to the Rust
                        language from C++, changes in the mining algorithm, payment and exchange APIs, atomic swap, and
                        more.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Final Words</h2>
                    <p>
                        Mimblewimble brings some vital enhancements to the existing blockchain technology. The main
                        advantages of the Mimblewimble protocol include long-term scalability, increased privacy and
                        confidentiality of transactions, the anonymity of usersâ€™ identity, and decreased time for
                        syncing
                        nodes. In 2019, two Mimblewimble implementations were introduced, Grin and Beam, that provide an
                        innovative alternative to existing cryptocurrencies in the blockchain network. Mimblewimble is a
                        young technology that is still undergoing testing to ensure its validity and capabilities for
                        effective transactions processing.
